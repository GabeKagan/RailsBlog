A quick "Hello World" type program using Rails 4.1.8 and its blog template. Cool, innerit?
I'm going to try and pick up as much as I can by expanding it and working through the documentation at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v4.1.8/getting_started.html.
It might be best to use a slightly newer version of Rails, but I don't expect enormous changes.
